# So here we will start with the basics i.e. tokens,keywords and data types

# print() is a function used in python to output (at the console) something. 

# Tokens : The smallest unit used im python is token. These can ...

""" Keywords : These are the reserved terms for any laguage and cannot be used by the user as a variable.Examples of keywords in
    Python are for,if,else,elif,class,def,in,or,and,while,not,True,False..."""

"""Data Types : These are categories that define what kind of some data is.For example 12 is a numerical data and "Rakesh" is a
    textual data.So both "Rakesh" and 12 can not tereated as one.Therefore languages define some categories to define this data called 
    Data Types.These are string (str),integer (int),floating point (float) and many more ."""

# integer data :
integer = 18
print(f"{integer} is of the type {type(integer)}")  # type() is a function that returns or tells the data type of any object 
""" here a special type of string substitution is used...it is called 'f string' ...in this we put an 'f' before any string then we 
    directly type the name of the variable name between '{}'"""
string = "The only thing that is constant is 'change'."
print(f"'{string}' is of the type {type(string)}")
float_value = 34.56
print(f"{float_value} is of the type {type(float_value)}")

# operators like '+','-','x' are used to conduct calculations .These are also provided by programming languages

# The plus ('+') operator ::=>
